# What can MyChatAdmin do for you?
Botname is the next gen Kik chat bot. It can take over your annoying admin tasks like kicking lurkers.
You can configure a max amount of people who are allowed in your group. When there are more people then desired, it will kick the least active member.

The bot will maintain a list of all group admins and exclude admins from his kick routine. So all your fellow admins are safe from accidental kicks.

# Get started
To get started using MyChatAdmin look at [our bots]({filename}bots.md) and choose an available bot.
Message him `friend`
He will respond and tell you, you are now able to invite him to any group you choose to.

Next step is to invite the bot to your group(s).

From now on, you can control it via simple group chat messages. For a full list see [commands]({filename}commands.md).
