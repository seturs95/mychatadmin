This bot is under active development.
There are currently a few planned features which will be released in the future.


This contains, but is not limited to these features:
* Custom greetings. You will be able to set a custom greeting to all members who join your group. This could be useful to announce group rules etc.
* Custom kick message. Currently the bot just removes people from your group. In the future you will be able to set a custom kick message. You will be able to enable/disable this.
* Custom bots: You will be able to request custom bots. With them you will be able to choose the name and picture. They will be exclusive for you.
* Whitelist: Protect special users from beeing removed without giving them full admin access to your group
* Display all curent settings
* Censor words: Kick users who use banned words.
* Kick users based on their account age. E.g. Users with newly created accounts just one or two days ago can be autokicked

* Anything else you could imagine. Just message me a feature request and i'll considere adding the feature.
