Title: MyChatAdmin is born

Today, the idea of MyChatAdmin was born. 

Lately i was around in a lot of quiet active kik groups. All those groups had one point in common. Lurkers. All over the group.

They did not contribute anything to the group, but occupied valuable spots in the group. As usual, the admin tries to remove all lurkers, 

but this is a tidious job. So i looked up `kik bots` and found Ragebot. At first, it seemed great and support everything i imagined.

But then, it stopped working. It just f*ing stopped kicking people. Asking support if this could be disabled, i was greeted with

"No you can't, this is a `security` feature."

Yeah great. But i WANT it to keep removing people.

That was the moment MyChatAdmin was born...

And the journey started
